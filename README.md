# Adaptive-Type-2-Fuzzy-Approach-for-Filtering-Salt-and-Pepper-Noise-in-Grayscale-Images
For removal of highly dense Salt and pepper noise the type 2 fuzzy based adaptive filter is designed. First layer of fuzzy type 2 approach is the type 1 fuzzy logic applied on neighbourhood of pixel.
GMF is used as membership function for this purpose. Parameters of which are dependent on pixel value and men of k middle applied for window size.
two approaches are specified\ A) distinct mean and same variance B) distinct mean and distinct variance.
First layer is used for the choice of good or bad pixels for the further assignment of new value for extreme valued pixel or to retain the older value. , in the second step, the pixels categorized as bad by first step or layer are to be de-noised. For de-noising, Type-1 fuzzy approach on a weighted mean of good pixels is used.
Performance of filter is tested on noise density from 20-90%.performance of devised filter is superior than state of art filter.
